Welcome to the **Consolidated Open Source Global Development Dataset (COSGDD)** repository! 🎉

This dataset is a one-stop resource for exploring global socio-economic, environmental, and governance indicators, meticulously compiled to support research, education, and policy-making.

## 📄 About the Dataset
COSGDD brings together data from multiple **open-source datasets**, including:
- The **World Happiness Report**
- The **Economist Democracy Index**
- **Environmental and economic databases**
- Data manually scraped from **Wikipedia** and other reliable open data sources.

## 🤓 Feature Engineering: A Funny Backstory

The feature engineering process for COSGDD involved a "quick" 10-minute consultation with my psychology professor. Spoiler alert: 10 minutes quickly turned into **over an hour 1/2** of brainstorming, debates, and deep dives into human behavior! 😂 

Who knew combining data science with psychology could be such an adventure? (Apparently, a simple question like, *"How do you measure freedom and happiness together?"* can spark a mini-lecture on human decision-making!)

Big thanks to my professor for the insightful and unexpectedly lengthy chat—it was worth every minute!

## 🚀 Why is This Work Novel?
1. **Consolidation of Diverse Sources**: Instead of relying on fragmented datasets, COSGDD integrates key global metrics into one cohesive resource.
2. **Feature Engineering**: We’ve created unique, feature-engineered columns (e.g., Freedom Index, Environmental Bonus) to provide deeper insights and facilitate advanced analyses.
3. **Accessibility and Utility**: COSGDD caters to a wide audience—researchers, policymakers, educators, and data enthusiasts—bridging the gap between complex data and practical insights.
4. **Ethical and Transparent**: All data sources are cited, and preprocessing methods are documented to ensure transparency.

## 📊 What Can You Do With COSGDD?
- Analyze patterns in global well-being, governance, and sustainability.
- Explore the interplay between wealth, happiness, and environmental metrics.
- Build machine learning models or conduct hypothesis testing with robust statistical power.
